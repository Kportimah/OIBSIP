          administration to technical support, require knowledge of computer
          hardware. This can open up a wider range of career paths. Informed
          Decision Making: Whether you're building a personal computer or
          advising a client, understanding hardware can help you make informed
          decisions about components, compatibility, and performance. Enhanced
          Problem-Solving Skills: Troubleshooting hardware issues can develop
          your analytical and problem-solving abilities, which are valuable
          skills in any IT career.

          I've worked in the fields of marketing, branding, and design for over
          a decade, with large, established firms and studios. I learned a lot
          from them but decided to fly solo by establishing my own consultancy.

          This is my way of bridging the gaps I saw in the industry, and of
